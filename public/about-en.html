  <h1 class='title'>About this Website:</h1>
<p>This website is hosted in Gitlab using the "Gitlab Pages" feature.
<br>
Gitlab itself is hosted in Google cloud in the USA, therefore this website is hosted in Google cloud in the USA.
<br>
As you can imagine this far from ideal but due to personal reason I can't spend money for this website (yet).
<br><br>
This website is entirely Static and Javascript-Free, at first this was the objective (and considering that Gitlab Pages don't allow dynamic websites this was the way to go) but this is now really limiting considering that I can't embed other open source project in it (I'm interested in a commenting system for example).
<br><br>
